ACEmulator custom content changes/additions using SQL scripts

Each release can be added to the servers by placing the entire folder with its structure in the ACEmulator server install directory. 
example: C:\ACE\Server\Content

So if you download the "Spell Instructor Upgrades" content the folder, its structure and all its contents should be placed in for example:
C:\ACE\Server\Content\Spell Instructor Upgrades

Most, if not all of the content change scripts found here can be played in Asheron's Call using ACEmulator:
